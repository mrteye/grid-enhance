# Project: Grid Enhance

The **Grid Enhance Engine** began with a simple but challenging goal: to break the boundaries of a fixed digital canvas. Standard AI image generators create amazing art, but often at a set resolution. The question was, how can we not only upscale these images but organically *grow* them, adding new, high-resolution detail section by section?

This project is the answer. It's a next-generation image editor that uses generative AI to expand and enhance images, creating a limitless space for creativity.

### **üöÄ About The Project**

Traditional image editors are constrained by a fixed canvas. Your creativity is limited by the pixels you start with. The Grid Enhance Engine shatters this limitation.

This tool divides any image into a grid, allowing you to modify, regenerate, or completely replace individual sections using simple text commands. The application's core innovation is its **dynamic scaling algorithm**: when a grid section is replaced with a higher-resolution or larger image, the entire canvas intelligently resizes to accommodate the new content, seamlessly blending original and generated data into a new, larger composition.

### **‚ú® Key Features**

  * **Dynamic Canvas Scaling:** The canvas intelligently grows to fit higher-resolution AI-generated or manually uploaded grid sections.
  * **AI-Powered Cell Modification:** Use text commands with the Gemini model to transform any grid section.
  * **Manual Grid Replacement:** Upload your own images to any grid cell for precise control.
  * **Project Persistence:** Save your entire project (base image, grid, replacements, metadata) to a local JSON file and load it later to continue your work.
  * **High-Resolution Export:** Export the final, dynamically-scaled composite image as a high-quality PNG.
  * **Interactive UI:** Simple controls for grid size, grid visibility, and project metadata.
